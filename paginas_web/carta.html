            <abbr title="subtitulo">Exotic dance moves</abbr><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, you are rigth! As part of my post-doctorade work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question<br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
        </p>
        <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
        <p id="parrafo">
            A tittle knowsn but very influential dance dating bask as far as 300BC, a Whole village would dance around<br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
        </p>
        <p>Icelandle brownian shuffle</p>
        <p id="parrafo">
            Before the Icelanders dveloped fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, witch<br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shufling their bodles around ip imperceptably<br> tiny very rapid movements.One
            of my fellow students used to say that the thougt this dance inspired<br> modem styles such as Twerking.<br>
        </p>
        <p> Artic robot dance </p>
        <p id="parrafo">
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believedto have
            <br> discovered a new dance stylecharacteristised by "roboide", stiled movements, being practiced by innhabitans<br> of Northem Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered it was discovered that they wew just moving like this
            <br> beacause they were really cold.<br>
        </p>
